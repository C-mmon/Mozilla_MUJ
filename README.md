## **Mozilla Community Code of Conduct**


## **Purpose**

The primary goal of this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, Mozilla MUJ is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines Mozilla MUJ's expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our activities and events to help us create a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## **Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship**

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. Please feel free to reach out via our social media channels. 

## **Expected Behavior**

All members of the Mozilla MUJ Community and attendees to our activities and events are expected to:

*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the Mozilla MUJ community.
*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow members and/or activity/event participants. Please alert the Mozilla MUJ community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

**Understand Different Perspective**

Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger. 

## **Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behaviors include: 

*   intimidating; 
*   harassing; 
*   abusive; 
*   discriminatory; 
*   derogatory or demeaning speech or actions 

by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public, so please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: 

*   harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; 
*   inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); 
*   inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); 
*   deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; 
*   sustained disruption of talks or other events; 
*   inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## **Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behavior from any Mozilla MUJ community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a Mozilla MUJ community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## **If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify any member of the Mozilla MUJ community leadership as soon as possible. You can find a list of organizers to contact for each of the supporters of this code of conduct at the bottom of this page. Additionally, Mozilla MUJ community leaders are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events or activities, Mozilla MUJ community organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## **Addressing Grievances**

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify any member of the Mozilla MUJ community leadership or event organizer with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be discussed and handled by the leadership of Mozilla MUJ accordingly.

## **Scope**

We expect all Mozilla MUJ community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

## **Data Protection**

Mozilla MUJ recognizes the importance of protecting the personal data of everyone we do business with, including volunteers, suppliers, and supporters. We believe that responsible stewardship of personal data is a critical part of maintaining trust and of ensuring that individuals feel confident that Mozilla MUJ respects their right to privacy. Mozilla MUJ will never distribute, sell (in exchange for monetary or non-monetary value), nor share participant and member data or information to anyone outside of the organization without written consent from the respective data subject/s.

## **TeamFreebies Clause**

All activities and events organized by the Mozilla MUJ Community (Mozilla MUJ) are carefully planned and well thought of. Being a non-profit organization, every cent that goes to the funding of our activities and events are very important. All Mozilla MUJ activities and events, unless otherwise stated or explicitly invited, require an RSVP from attendees. At present, Mozilla MUJ utilizes Eventbrite.com for RSVP purposes. Mozilla MUJ does not tolerate any form of gatecrashing to our activities and events. We reserve the right to deny entry to anyone who had previously been found violating this Code of Conduct or had failed to RSVP to any of our activities or event. This is done to ensure that all those who RSVPd will be accommodated. Registrants who fail to attend without canceling his/her RSVP have been barred from signing-up for our future activities and events.

## **Reporting**


After receiving a concise description of your situation, the leadership of Mozilla MUJ will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately address each situation. 

Please also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.
